Snapdt. (pronounced as 'snapped') is a portfolio website by and for photography enthusiasts. The purpose of the project is that users can view photographs updated frequently by the developer. Upon viewing, users can order the photographs, printed on a canvas, or simply appreciate them.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As first time visitors, users should be able to easily understand the narrative of the site, namely that it concerns a photography website.
        2. As first time visitors, users should be easily navigate through the pages and view the content.
        3. As first time visitors, users should be able to purchases on the website.
        4. As first time visitors, users should be able to display all products (portfolio) in one page.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As returning visitors, users should be able to log in to their personal accounts (if created).
        2. As returning visitors, users should be able to view their order history.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As frequent visitors, users view any new or updated content.
        2. As frequent visitors, users may come back to sign up to the newsletter to be notified, once new content has been added.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   For the color design, I chose a dual color background with a diagonal split. Each main page has different colors that complement each other. Color palettes are generated by [flatuicolors](https://flatuicolors.com/). To keep all colors calm, I chose for #252b31, because it makes the brighter colors more vivid.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Poppins is very popular with web design. Even though Poppins is the 'go-to' font in many websites, I felt that making most text in uppercase, including the navigation menu, makes the site more rebust.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is the core of this site, since it's purpose and rationale evolves around photography. To avoid a cluttered look by having too many picture and photographs, I decided to fill the backgrounds with solid colors.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. For first time visitors, it wasn't very easy to understand the rationale of the project since the information concerning this is quite limited.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. In the middle of the page there is a block containing a welcome message and a call to action to view the portfolio.
        3. The user only has one option; click the call to action buttons and the user will be navigation to the portfolio page.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, it was very easy to navigate through the website.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar and below a visible footer, tempting the users to click on links to other projects.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, the user can easily hover over an image to display the descriptive text and click on the image to further view the description of the photograph and the option to place an order.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, the user can check to see if there are any newly added photographs.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, users should be able to login into their own profile and view their information (e.g. order history and address information).

        1. The users can update their address information at any time.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers (iPad).
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Laptop, iPhone 11, iPad & Google Pixels.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly, as well as making sure all pages were responsive.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   For some reason, at resolution with width 1200px, the block on the homage would jump to the bottm and middel of the page, which was not supposed to happen. This was fixed by making the block centered in all pages by using grid 12 from Bootstrap (col-12).
    -   When including the footer, there were some marking issues with the margins, since there was no distinctive gap between the main page section and footer. This was fixed using bootstraps my-5.
-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.

## Deployment

### For Development Purposes

The website has been deployed on Heroku and is currently publicly accessible.  
The development of the website has been undertaken on Gitpod.  

The steps from start to present were:-

**Connection to GitHub repository**

  1. Creation of repository on GitHub, using Code Institute template.
  2. Freeze requirements of extensions added to the programme:-

          pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
      *This needs to be done after any extentions are added during Development.*
  3. Create a Procfile and add the following code into the item:-
          web: gunicorn cost_report.wsgi:application

**Set up AWS S3 account** (to host static files and other media/uploads)
  1. Create and set up an AWS S3 Bucket
  2. Install boto3 and django-storages through pip
  3. Add 'storages' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
  4. Update settings.py to use AWS for file storage
  5. Create a custom_storages.py file in the main directory and set new classes for storage to the S3 bucket

**Deployment to Heroku**

  1. Creation of a new App on Heroku
  2. Go to 'Deployment Method' -> Select 'GitHub' and search for the repository that you want to deploy via Heroku from GitHub.
  3. Go to 'Settings' and 'Reveal Config Vars' -> Input the settings required to deploy the website
  4. Go to 'Deploy' and select to Enable Automatic Deploys
  5. Set the database in settings.py:-

          DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
                }
      where 'DATABASE_URL' is the location of the database to be used on the deployed site.
  6. Run migrations
  7. Add the app name to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py

The website is now deployed and can be viewed at:
